# Prism themes

This repository lists a selection of additional themes for the [Prism syntax highlighting library](http://prismjs.com/).

## How to use a theme

To use one of the themes, just include the theme's CSS file in your page. Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        ...
        <link href="themes/prism-ghcolors.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
        <script src="prism.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
